This week we had took our medterm i chose to focus on question 4 it shows that 70.4% of students choose letter a and 11.1 chose c and d. The correct answer is correct bcause theprogram is (+(-3 2) (+5 6)) than means 3-2 is 1 and 5 + 6 is 11 and then you would have to add them then your answer is 12 and that is why letter a is correct. But this week we learned how to put our background for the video game on the program and what the mauin charecter and whats the danger in the game.
