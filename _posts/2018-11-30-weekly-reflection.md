This week we had took our medterm i chose to focus on question 4 it shows that 70.4% of students choose letter a and 11.1 chose c and d. The correct answer is a bcause theprogram is (+(-3 2) (+5 6)) than means 3-2 is 1 and 5 + 6 is 11 and then you would have to add them then your answer is 12 and that is why letter a is correct. Sudent had chosen c or d becase they would think they would have to subtract the one at the end which would make it a negative number which would give them 10 but they had to add.
